Functional Programing Android architecture approaches using [Arrow](http://arrow-kt.io/).

# How to import it

The library being used here to fetch super newsItems is the [MarvelApiClientAndroid](https://github.com/Karumi/MarvelApiClientAndroid)
from [Karumi](https://github.com/Karumi). Since it's targeting the real [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/), 
you will need to add `marvelPublicKey=your_public_key` and `marvelPrivateKey=your_private_key` to 
your home `gradle.properties` to be able to compile or run it. You can also add them by command line: 

`./gradlew detektCheck build -PmarvelPublicKey="\"whatever\"" -PmarvelPrivateKey="\"whatever\""`

# Approach used

This project uses the so called `Tagless-Final` Functional Programming style. Tagless-Final is focused on never depending on concrete data types like Option or Try, but make the program depend on an unknown `F` type end to end instead. Then we use Type Class constraints (behaviors) that work over that `F` to encode our programs, leaving the decision about which concrete type to use (or in other words: what type fix `F` to) to the moment when we are ready to run the code, or in other words, the "Runtime".

## IO

Once you're at the "edge of the world" to run your program, you'll pass a proper runtime. In this sample we are fixing the `F` type that the program remains agnostic of to be `IO`. But it could actually be any type that supports asynchrony and concurrency, since those are the only constraints we have for this program.
